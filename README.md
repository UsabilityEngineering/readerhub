# ReaderHub

ReaderHub is mainly a platform that aims to connect readers all around the world, allowing them to interact and share opinions about books on top of being able to create their own online library, write reviews, remain updated about the latest news in the publishing scene and receive recommendations based on past interactions. It is important to understand though that the focus of ReaderHub is the social media aspect. This is because this aspect is completely lacking in every one of the competitors that we analyzed, and readers usually turn to more traditional social media apps to talk about their interests. Therefore, ReaderHub wants to provide a platform that would give readers what they don't have right now, a space dedicated only to them.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* **Competitive analysis** showed what was lacking on the main websites and apps used by readers
    [social media platform] : readers do not have a dedicated place for them to connect directly to people who share their interests.
* **Heuristic Evaluation** of competitors found many websites cluttered with advertisements and overall the design was not simple. Language of shortcuts might pose a     problem to non-English speakers. Lots of steps to be taken to add or remove books.
* Personas and scenarios underlined the users' most important needs
    * **desire to connect** with other people who share interests
    * need to **discover new books**, and to know what other people thought of those books
* **Sketches** and **Diagrams** show initial design concepts
    * **Simple designs** to only show you what you want while being intuitive to use
    * Focus on the **social aspect** like messaging
    * The flow Diagram shows the initial concept of user interaction

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

During this phase, the tools of wireframes and cognitive walkthroughs were used to further push the project forward. The work done was also informally reviewed by peers.

**Wireframes** show all possible interactions between the user and the program. 
* It was found that social media **workflows** are **complicated** with a lot of **interaction**. 
* It became clear that designing every function that a platform like readerhub can be complicated to design since **many actions** can be performed on a single page.

**Cognitive Walkthroughs** let you get some user interaction and feedback on how to accomplish tasks. 
* It was found that our wireframe needed to make our buttons **clearer** to the user. 
* The features designed may or may not be used by **users** as they have **different needs**.
* Going forward the **interactions** between the user and the wireframe will be more clear. 


During the next phase, the focus will be on making the user interaction smoother than it is now with minimal **visual design**.
