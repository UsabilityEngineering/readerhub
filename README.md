# ReaderHub

ReaderHub is mainly a social media platform that aims to connect readers all around the world, allowing them to interact and share opinions about books on top of being able to create their own online library, write reviews, remain updated about the latest news in the publishing scene and receive recommendations based on previous ratings and reviews. It is important to understand though that the focus of ReaderHub is the social media aspect. This is because this aspect is completely lacking in every one of the competitors that we analyzed, and readers usually turn to more traditional social media apps to talk about their interests. Therefore, ReaderHub wants to provide a platform that would give readers what they don't have right now, a space dedicated only to them.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* **Competitive analysis** showed what was lacking on the main websites and apps used by readers
    [social media platform] : readers do not have a dedicated place for them to connect directly to people who share their interests.
* **Heuristic Evaluation** of competitors found many websites cluttered with advertisements and overall the design was not simple. Language of shortcuts might pose a     problem to non-English speakers. Lots of steps to be taken to add or remove books.
* Personas and scenarios underlined the users' most important needs
    * **desire to connect** with other people who share interests
    * need to **discover new books**, and to know what other people thought of those books
