# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes
Readerhub: Max Hibbard, Anna Di Iulio 

During these weeks we focused more on making a first step towards creating a finalized working prototype. We used Adobe XD to create a wireframe of what our website would look like, illustrating all of the functionalities that each page would feature. 
Once we were done with this step our peers performed a cognitive walkthrough using the personas we had previously created and gave us feedback on our wireframes.
 
## Wireframes 
**Method**

Wireframes show all possible interactions between the user and the program. A wireframe shows each possible page in those interactions in a basic way without any visual design.
**Findings**

The interaction on a wireframe made for social media interaction is complicated as there are a lot of factors to take into consideration. For example, the entire profile interaction is a complicated process as you need to let them see their book library, let them edit their profile, and post. 
The whole wireframe is involved in a complicated process in order to make sure all possible interactions are covered. As discussed above, each page might have a ton of possible interactions in order to cover social media content. When editing their profile, it includes editing their Bio, username, password, user photo, ect. Changing their password requires a new page to verify their current password and what they want their new password to be. Each page also features the menu at the top which can navigate through the wireframe.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
**Method**

Cognitive walkthroughs lets you get some user interaction and feedback on how to accomplish tasks. You take a persona and try to accomplish their goals through their perspective in a step by step interaction of the wireframes.

**Findings**

Cognitive Walkthrough - Caroline

The cognitive walkthrough for Caroline illustrated that our users will all have different goals and needs from our site. In the sign up page, we asked for a first name instead of a username. The user wondered why the website would ask for a first name as the convention is usually a username. The interaction informed us that the search bar, and the edit profile button was not identifiable for this user. Since the user was not able to identify the search bar, they could not access the search page and book pages. It informed us that the help page might be ignored in order to explore the site themselves.


Cognitive Walkthrough - John

The cognitive walkthrough for John illustrated that users may have some confusion once on the homepage. It was not clear enough that to explore for books, you needed to get to the search page. However, once there the user was able to correctly identify the interaction needed to search for fantasy books. 

## Conclusions

Overall these methods and tools allowed us to discover a lot about how our users are going to interact with the product, even if they only interacted with the wireframes for now, which are only a first step of how our final website is going to look like.

We decided to take into account the critiques that were made and use them to build something that is easier to interact with. For example, we made the buttons and the texts bigger in order to be easier to understand. This was done also with the search bar that is almost always present at the top of the screen since there seemed to be a bit of uncertainty about how it should be used. We also added a more clear “edit profile” button in the profile page since it was in a less evident location.

After the cognitive walkthrough we realized that there were a lot of things missing from our wireframes, so we went through them again and added more details and artboards that would make the interaction a lot easier for the user. 

## Caveats

* There is limited user interaction in the cognitive walkthrough.
* There is no visual feedback to illustrate what you are doing when you interact with the wireframes.
* The workflow of our platform can become complicated.
* What may have played a role in the issues our peers had during the cognitive walkthrough is that the wireframes themselves were less precise than what we have now.
